                <h1>Favorite Sport</h1>
                <p>I began playing basketball in 5th grade and have loved it ever since. I try to go play pick up
                    games or shoot around with my friends whenever I have free time. I find it to be both a fun time
                    and good exercise. Additionally, I enjoy keeping up-to-date with what is happening inside of 
                    the National Basketball Association.

                    One of my favorite basketball moments is this picture that I took a few years ago of Kevin Durant.
                    I am from California so I was able to go to a Golden State Warriors game and saw some of my
                    favorite players including Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.
