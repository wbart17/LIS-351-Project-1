                <h1>Favorite Animal</h1>
                <p>My favorite type of animals are dogs, as can be seen from the attached photo. This photo
                    is of my dog Jasper who is now around 12 years old. I got him when I was in 4th grade.
                    At first, my parents never wanted a dog, but my brother and I would ask them every single
                    day for one. Eventually they gave in.
                    <br><br>
                    Jasper is half-Maltese and half-Yorkie.
