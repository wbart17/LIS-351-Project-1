                <h1>Favorite Food</h1>
                <p>Being half-Japanese, I have been exposed to Japanese cuisine since I was born. Although
                    I like much of which the cuisine has to offer, sushi has definitely become my favorite.
                    My favorite type of sushi is nigiri, which is a slice of raw fish over rice.
                    <br><br>
                    The picture attached is one that I took the last time that I visited Tokyo, Japan. There
                    are several different types of tuna on the board, my favorite being the toro.
